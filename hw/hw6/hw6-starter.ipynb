    "At this point we are at the end of supervised machine learning part of the course. So in this homework, you will be working on an open-ended mini-project, where you will put all the different things you have learned so far together to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes and tips when you work on this mini-project: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This mini-project is open-ended, and while working on it, there might be some situations where you'll have to use your own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). Make sure you explain your decisions whenever necessary. \n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have your final code. That said, your code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code. \n",
    "3. If you realize that you are repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of your code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. You may use code from lecture notes or previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions. \n",
    "4. If you are having trouble running models on your laptop because of the size of the dataset, you can create your train/test split in such a way that you have less data in the train split. If you end up doing this, please write a note to the grader in the submission explaining why you are doing it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to grade fairly and leniently. We don't have some secret target score that you need to achieve to get a good grade. **You'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results.** For example, if you just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If you do a bunch of sane things and get a lower accuracy than your friend, don't sweat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A final note\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this style of this \"project\" question is different from other assignments. It'll be up to you to decide when you're \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. But please don't spend WAY too much time on this... perhaps \"a few hours\" (2-8 hours???) is a good guideline for a typical submission. Of course if you're having fun you're welcome to spend as much time as you want! But, if so, try not to do it out of perfectionism or getting the best possible grade. Do it because you're learning and enjoying it. Students from the past cohorts have found such kind of labs useful and fun and I hope you enjoy it as well. "

In this data set, there are about 18.000 examples and 18 features (including the target), and the goal is to estimate whether a person will cancel their booking; this column is labeled \"booking_status\" in the data (1 = canceled). \n",

    "1. Spend some time understanding the problem and what each feature means. You can find this information in the documentation on [the dataset page on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/reservation-cancellation-prediction?select=train__dataset.csv). Write a few sentences on your initial thoughts on the problem and the dataset. \n",

    "1. The goal of this experiment is to create a model to help hotels predict whether a not a reservation will be honored based on information about the customer. There are 18 total features in the dataset. All features are numerical. 10 of these features are not continuous values and instead have values that represent discrete classes in each feature. Three of these discrete features are binary representations and the remaining seven are ordinally encoded. The target column is a binary representation, therefore this prediction is a classification problem and not a regression problem. "

    "1. From the eli5 summary chart, we can see that the features of lead_time, avg_price_per_room, no_of_special_requests, and market_segment_type_1 are the features with the heightest weight in feature importance for the LGBMClassifier model.  Lead time may allow more time for cancellation due to schedule changes so this may increase cancellation rate. A higher price is a larger commitment which may increase the likelihood of cancellation. With higher numbers of special requests, it is likely that if these requests are not met, the cancellation rate would increase. <br><br>"

    "2. The test scores are similar to the mean cross validation scores generated from before. The individual scores indicate that the model is performing decently well while there is still some room for improvement, particularly for recall. For instance, a score of 0.7545 suggests that there are some positive instances that the model missed, and thus there are some false negatives. Furthermore, since the performance on the training data and test data are similar, there seems to be little overfitting to the training data for the model. Therefore, we would not expect issues concerning optimization bias. \n",

We observed that ensemble models generally performed more accurately than simple Logistical Regression (with scores around 80%) and the DummyClassifier (with scores around 66%). Hyperparameter optimization with GridSearchCV did not significantly increase the test scores, however, it did raise the LGBM model's training scores from ~85% to over 95% in some cases. Perhaps this signifies some overfitting. Furthermore, feature importance analysis showed that lead_time, avg_price_per_room, no_of_special_requests, and the OHE feature market_segment_type_1 were the most predictive features of whether or not someone would cancel their booking. \n",
