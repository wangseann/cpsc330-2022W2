Precision is relatively low meaning that of the predicted positive examples, many were false positive errors. Recall being low as well means that of all positive examples, only about 23-27% were correctly predicted in the training set, with a lower range present in the test set. Both these metrics are combined in an F1 score that is relatively low for both the training and test sets. These metrics suggest that our model is not preforming well in correctly predicting positive examples. "
